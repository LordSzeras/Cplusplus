Project Summary:
  The goal of this project was to create a program that took user input
  in the form of an intital deposit, monthly deposits, an interest rate
  and a number of years to invest, and output two graphs showing interest
  gained both with and without the monthly deposits.  Mainly, build an app
  that lets people see how much growth can be had from depositing money
  into an account each month instead of just making a single deposit and
  seeing what happens.
  
What went well:
  First, it works.  I feel for any project there is a certain amount of
  warm fuzzies that arrive when it works, and I have them.
  
  Second, I think I did a good job in testing each aspect of the code
  and writing said code in increments.  For example, I made a function
  to calculate the interest gained and adjust the account details on a
  monthly basis first, and then made a function to use that function
  twelve times to simulate one year.
  
  Third, my input validation seemed to catch everything I could think
  that a person might input that was not one of the menu options.  The
  way I handled anything else seems to work well.
  
What could be improved:
  The code could be cleaned up a bit.  I was looking at the code and noticed
  small things like having #inlcude <vector> when my final version of the
  code does not use any vectors.  There are probably better ways I could
  write one or two of the functions, or even split them up.  Uncle Bob
  would probably find a way to split up two of my primary functions into
  several different functions that would make the code more polite.
  
Challenges:
  Input validation.  I had the hardest time with validating for alpha
  characters being entered instead of numbers.  I ended up doing a bit
  of google searching to find the pieces I needed for that particular
  bit of code.  
  
Transferable skills:
  I think the mindset that I had to develop for this project will help
  the most.  This was the first project that had to be done from scratch
  and while you can create from scratch quickly, it isn't always good.
  
Polite code:
  I tried to use short yet detailed comments and small to the point functions.
  While I don't think I did my best, I think anyone could come behind
  me and see what I was doing without much issue.  It is a very basic
  class and should be able to be changed without breaking other parts
  of the code.
  
Reflection:
  I think overall that this was a solid attempt at doing what was asked.
  I can most assuredly improve in many aspects of coding and given that 
  the first thing I did when choosing to upload a project was to give
  my code a second look.  I immediately found issues and was honest with
  myself about them adn that they were small things that could make or 
  break future projects.  Hopefully, I can catch these during the project
  in the future and not after.
